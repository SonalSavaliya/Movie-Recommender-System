# Movie-Recommender-System-using-Spark-with-PySpark

Built a movie recommendation system using explicit feedback of movie ratings by user's aka Alternating Least Squares (ALS) - Collaborative Filtering. I have used Spark with PySpark API, Spark SQL and Spark MLlib for this project.

I used a small dataset from MovieLens Dataset, [movielens data set](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), becuase of my computer's limit.

### Please open the Jupyter notebook file for a complete view of the project with a detailed explanation.
